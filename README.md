# NGS-Variant-Discovery-Pipeline-GATK
## Note - Workflow inprogress

This repository demonstrates a real-world, end-to-end NGS variant analysis pipeline, starting from raw sequencing reads to align, preprocess, discover variants, filter quality, annotate functionality, and validate results.

The pipeline includes:

1. High-quality read alignment to a reference genome
2. Sorting, duplicate marking, and base quality recalibration
3. Variant calling using industry-standard tools
4. Variant filtering and quality assessment
5. Functional annotation to interpret biological impact
6. Visualization for manual verification of variant regions

This specific workflow and related material provided by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, and all steps are executed in a reproducible manner using scripted workflows and controlled software environments.
